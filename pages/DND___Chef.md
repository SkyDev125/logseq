# ðŸŽ» Bard: College of Resonant Echoes
- ---
- ## Overview
- Bards of the **College of Resonant Echoes** do not merely perform songs; they **conduct the lingering harmonies of existence**.
  
  They attune to the **resonant memory** left behind by ancient magic, history, and emotion, weaving these echoes into powerful manifestations.
  
  To such bards, sound is reality, memory is substance, and performance is alignment with the Worldsong.

- ## ðŸŒ€ Guiding Echoes
  
  (*3rd Level*)
  
  You learn the *Guidance* cantrip, which doesn't count against your bard cantrips known.
  
  When you cast *Guidance*, it manifests as a **resonant harmonic field** around the target instead of visible magic.
  
  Additionally, its range increases to **60 feet** for you.

- ## ðŸ§¿ Resonant Focus
  
  (*3rd Level*)
  
  You channel magic through **resonant tools** such as a tuning fork, resonant prism, vibrating shell, or sonic node, which can serve as your bardic spellcasting focus.
  
  At 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that **deals damage or restores hit points** through your Resonant Focus, you roll a **d6** and add the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell.

- ## ðŸŽ¶ Echoes from Beyond
  
  (*3rd Level*)
  
  You weave the forgotten memories of existence into new manifestations.
  
  While holding your Resonant Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the **Echoes Table** using your Bardic Inspiration die.
  
  You retain the chosen echo in mind until you **bestow it** on a creature within 30 feet (action required), or until you finish a short or long rest.
  
  You can hold only one Echo at a time.
  
  If the echo requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.
  
  *(The Echoes Table uses the same effects as Spirit Tales, just rethemed as "echoes" instead of "tales.")*

- | Bardic Inspiration Die Roll | Resonant Echo | Effect |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | 1 | **Echo of the Clever Instinct** | For the next 10 minutes, whenever the target makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check, they roll an extra die (same type as your Bardic Inspiration die) and add it to the check. |
  | 2 | **Echo of the Dueling Will** | You make a melee spell attack against a target. On a hit, it takes force damage equal to **two rolls** of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. |
  | 3 | **Echo of the Shared Heart** | The target and one creature within 5 feet of them both gain temporary hit points equal to **one roll** of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. |
  | 4 | **Echo of the Fading Step** | The target can immediately use their reaction to **teleport up to 30 feet** to an unoccupied space they can see. When they teleport, they can choose creatures (up to your Charisma modifier) within 30 feet to **also teleport** in the same way. |
  | 5 | **Echo of the Avenging Pulse** | For 1 minute, any creature that hits the target with a melee attack takes force damage equal to **one roll** of your Bardic Inspiration die. |
  | 6 | **Echo of the Wandering Path** | The target gains temporary hit points equal to **one roll** of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Bard level. While they have these hit points, their walking speed increases by 10 feet and they gain +1 AC. |
  | 7 | **Echo of the Shifting Mind** | The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to **two rolls** of your Bardic Inspiration die, and become **incapacitated** until the end of its next turn. |
  | 8 | **Echo of the Vanishing Form** | The target becomes **invisible** until the end of its next turn or until it hits a creature with an attack. If it hits, the creature struck takes necrotic damage equal to **one roll** of your Bardic Inspiration die and is **frightened** of the target until end of their next turn. |
  | 9 | **Echo of the Thunderous Step** | Each creature of the targetâ€™s choice within 30 feet must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take thunder damage equal to **three rolls** of your Bardic Inspiration die and are knocked prone. Success = half damage and no prone. |
  | 10 | **Echo of the Worldâ€™s Breath** | The target breathes out a 30-foot cone of resonant fire. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to **four rolls** of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failure, or half as much on a success. |
  | 11 | **Echo of the Restoring Chord** | The target regains hit points equal to **two rolls** of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. In addition, one condition (blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned) ends on them. |
  | 12 | **Echo of the Unfathomable Tune** | The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take psychic damage equal to **three rolls** of your Bardic Inspiration die and be **stunned** until the end of their next turn. |
- ## ðŸŽµ Resonant Spellweaving
  
  (*6th Level*)
  
  Your mastery of resonance allows you to manipulate spells in unique ways.
  
  Once per long rest, when you cast a bard spell of 1st level or higher, you can apply **one** of the following Resonant Spellweaving options:
- | Option | Effect |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | **Twin** | If the spell normally targets only one creature, you can target a second creature within range with the same spell. |
  | **Split** | If the spell normally affects an area (cone, sphere, cube, line), you can split the area into two separate zones of **half the original size** each, centered on different points within range. |
  | **Delay** | You can delay the spell's activation until the **start of your next turn**, holding the resonance until the perfect moment. |

- ## ðŸ§˜ Resonant Communion
  
  (*6th Level*)
  
  You can conduct a **resonant ritual** during a short or long rest with a number of willing creatures up to your proficiency bonus (including yourself).
  
  At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn **one spell** of your choice from **any class**, provided it is a **Divination** or **Necromancy** spell and of a level you can cast (maximum level = number of participants).
  
  This spell counts as a bard spell for you but does not count against your number of spells known.
  
  You forget the spell at the end of your next long rest.
  
  You can perform this ritual **once per long rest**.
