# ðŸŽ» Bard: College of Resonant Echoes
- ---
- ## Overview
- Bards of the **College of Resonant Echoes** do not merely perform songs; they **conduct the lingering harmonies of existence**.
  
  They attune to the **resonant memory** left behind by ancient magic, history, and emotion, weaving these echoes into powerful manifestations.
  
  To such bards, sound is reality, memory is substance, and performance is alignment with the Worldsong.

- ## ðŸŒ€ Guiding Echoes
  
  (*3rd Level*)
  
  You learn the *Guidance* cantrip, which doesn't count against your bard cantrips known.
  
  When you cast *Guidance*, it manifests as a **resonant harmonic field** around the target instead of visible magic.
  
  Additionally, its range increases to **60 feet** for you.

- ## ðŸ§¿ Resonant Focus
  
  (*3rd Level*)
  
  You channel magic through **resonant tools** such as a tuning fork, resonant prism, vibrating shell, or sonic node, which can serve as your bardic spellcasting focus.
  
  At 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that **deals damage or restores hit points** through your Resonant Focus, you roll a **d6** and add the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell.

- ## ðŸŽ¶ Echoes from Beyond
  
  (*3rd Level*)
  
  You weave the forgotten memories of existence into new manifestations.
  
  While holding your Resonant Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the **Echoes Table** using your Bardic Inspiration die.
  
  You retain the chosen echo in mind until you **bestow it** on a creature within 30 feet (action required), or until you finish a short or long rest.
  
  You can hold only one Echo at a time.
  
  If the echo requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.
  
  *(The Echoes Table uses the same effects as Spirit Tales, just rethemed as "echoes" instead of "tales.")*
