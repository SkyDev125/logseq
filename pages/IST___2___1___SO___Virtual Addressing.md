- Notes
	- Memory Management Unit
		- Redirects "virtual addresses" to actual addresses in memory.
		- Segmentation
		  collapsed:: true
			- Cons
				- High fragmentation
				- Replaces the current block with an equal or smaller block from swap
				- the process wont use all the memory allocated for it. internal fragmentation too.
		- Pagination
		  collapsed:: true
			- Properties
				- Split in multiple small pages
				- Each process thinks it has the entire memory for itself.
				- Page table converts the Process memory to real memory
				- Unused Pages go to swap.
				- Presence Bit lets us know if the page is in primary or secondary memory
			- Pros
				- Programmer doesnt need to worry about any virtual memory
				- Better use of Real Memory
			- Cons
				- Fragmented Processes are slower
				- Instructions need to be restartable due to fragmentation of processes.
			- Calculating physical address
				- Virtual Address + Offset
		- TBL - Translation Lookaside Buffer
			- Stores most commonly used page addresses so it doesnt waste time going to the table and waiting for conversion
			- Small buffer (size changes based on quantum)
			- Operating system updates it each time it fails to access a specific page.
