- Notes
	- Pseudo-Concurrency
		- The operating system can only have as many Threads as there are cpu cores* runing simultaneously.
		- Which means, that even if we create thousands of processes, the Operating system can still allow them to work, by scheduling them to operate at different time intervals, based on their priority and user needs. (e.g the window on the foreground is more important than one in the background)

	- Child Processes
		- States
			- Zombie
		- When created:
			- The operating system guarantees that the child can access an exact copy (snapshot) of memory of the Parent Process
		- After exiting
			- The child will be in a "Zombie" state, where it will keep its information waiting for the parent to retrieve it, or dismiss it.
