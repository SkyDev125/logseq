- Notes
	- Pseudo-Concurrency
		- The operating system can only have as many Threads as there are cpu cores* runing simultaneously.
		- Which means, that even if we create thousands of processes, the Operating system can still allow them to work, by scheduling them to operate from x to y, pausing, and then continuing some other process, following their priority and some optimization

	- Child Processes
		- States
			- Zombie
		- When created:
			- The operating system guarantees that the child can access an exact copy (snapshot) of memory of the Parent Process
		- After exiting
			- The child will be in a "Zombie" state, where it will keep its information waiting for the parent to retrieve it, or dismiss it.
